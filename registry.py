"""registry.py -- data/registry/, and the four rules its README specifies.

THE MANUAL SAYS WHAT A PRODUCT IS; THE REGISTRY SAYS WHETHER IT IS CURRENT.
The corpus is a snapshot of two documents that were already out of date when
they were scanned. This module is the layer that stops the system answering
from them as though they were current.

WHY THE RULES ARE CODE AND NOT PROMPT TEXT. generate.py already learned this
once, in the post-filter: five prompt wordings were measured against the same
trap and every one either permitted the leak, over-suppressed, or created a
leak in a model that had been clean. A prompt rule is advice; the model
decides how to comply, and "explain why this figure no longer applies" is a
compliant reading of every prohibition tried. These four are not advice. A
question about a suspended product gets the suspension sentence whatever the
model intended, and a question whose answer the field team has withdrawn gets
the withdrawal sentence with no model call at all.

THE FOUR RULES, in the README's words and in falling precedence:

  4  question matches a not_available topic -> say bot_says_bn, and never
     fall back to the manual's old figure.      STRONGEST: replaces outright.
  2  a retrieved chunk's clause is in rule_updates with verdict changed /
     retired / not_confirmed -> do not quote the manual's version as
     current; say current_rule_bn and cite the clause as the outdated source.
  1  a product is named in the question -> say status_line_bn FIRST, and if
     it is suspended say so before any terms.
  3  the answer contains an old_term -> use new_term, keeping the manual
     clause cited as written.

Precedence is 4, 2, 1, 3 because that is the order of how wrong the
alternative is. 4 withholds a figure the field team says is gone; 2 corrects
one the manual still prints; 1 frames an answer that is otherwise accurate;
3 is wording.

NO PRODUCT NAME IS MATCHED HERE. Convention 2: productmatch owns what a
product name looks like as a pattern. The registry supplies the strings --
it is edited by the field team, not by this repo -- and productmatch.
compile_names turns them into one, so there is still exactly one owner.
